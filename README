			     GRISBI

Grisbi is a personal accounting application for Linux, written with
Gtk and released under the GPL license.

Our aim is to provide you with the most simple and intuitive software
for basic use, although it can be very powerful if you spend a little
time on the setup.

Grisbi is an application written by French developers, so it
perfectly respects French accounting rules. Grisbi can manage multiple
accounts, currencies and users. It manages third party, expenditure
and receipt categories, budgetary lines, financial years, budget
estimates, bankcard management and other information that make Grisbi
adapted for associations.

The complete manual is available on line. The version that comes with
the software is illustrated, but you can replace it by the
non-illustrated version at any time, which is available for download on
line.

If you want to keep updated with Grisbi releases, you may subscribe to
the mailing list infos@grisbi.org (see Contacts) and if you like to
live dangerously you even can download the unstable sources from Git
and compile them.

Grisbi is free software, any contribution is welcome.

This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for
use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (https://www.openssl.org/).
